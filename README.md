# Weather-Application
The Weather Application is a robust web service developed using Spring Boot that provides real-time weather data based on user-specified geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). It integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant metrics.
